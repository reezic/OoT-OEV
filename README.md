#### _Notes_:
[Sanqui's "Obsidian Persistent Graph Plugin"](https://github.com/libasoles/graph-view-text-size) is included in this project.<br>
When loading a template, press CTRL+P, then search for "restore" and click "Persistent Graph: Restore graph node locations" to load the correct node locations.

To save your own locations, press CRTL+P, then search for "save" and click "Persistent Graph: Save graph node positions".

<br>

[libasoles' unofficial "Graph View Text Size" plugin](https://github.com/libasoles/graph-view-text-size) is included in this project.<br>
If for some reason the node text colors are not updating, try clicking one of the tag nodes, or manually disable and re-enable the color switch by going into Options -> Community Plugins -> Enter "Graph View Text Size"'s options -> "Match node color".
