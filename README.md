#### _Notes_:
_[Sanqui's "Obsidian Persistent Graph Plugin"](https://github.com/libasoles/graph-view-text-size) is included in this project.<br>
When loading a template, press CTRL+P, then search for "restore" and click "Persistent Graph: Restore graph node locations" to load the correct node locations._

_To save your own locations, press CRTL+P, then search for "save" and click "Persistent Graph: Save graph node positions"._

<br>

_[libasoles' unofficial "Graph View Text Size" plugin](https://github.com/libasoles/graph-view-text-size) is included in this project.<br>
If for some reason the node text colors are not matching the node colors when you open the project or reset positions using the Persistent Graph plugin, you can manually re-enable them by going into Options -> Community Plugins -> Enter "Graph View Text Size"'s options, then toggle "Match node color" off and on again._
