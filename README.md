#### _Notes_:
_Sanqui's "Obsidian Persistent Graph Plugin" is included in this project.<br>
When loading a template, press CTRL+P, then search for "restore" and click "Persistent Graph: Restore graph node locations" to load the correct node locations._

_To save your own locations, press CRTL+P, then search for "save" and click "Persistent Graph: Save graph node positions"._

<br>

_libasoles' unofficial "Graph View Text Size" plugin is included in this project.<br>
If for some reason the node text colors are not matching the node colors when you open the project or reset positions using the Persistent Graph plugin, you can manually re-enable them by going into Options -> Community Plugins -> Enter "Graph View Text Size"'s options, then toggle "Match node color" off and on again._

#### Plugins
This project comes pre-loaded with a couple of handy Obsidian plugins to make the experience a bit more user-friendly.

##### Graph View Text Size
libasoles' unofficial _Graph View Text Size_ plugin lets you adjust the font size of nodes in Obsidian's graph view, and allows for matching a node's text color with the node color, which makes it a lot easier to read the map at a glance.

Check it out here: https://github.com/libasoles/graph-view-text-size

##### Obsidian Persistent Graph Plugin
Sanqui's _Obsidian Persistent Graph Plugin_ lets you save the locations of your graph nodes so that it stays the same between sessions!
